# Object Detection

This repository contains my implementation of object detection from scratch in Tensorflow to better understand how the end to end process. I've tried to keep the code minimal and understandable, and comment on it as much as I can.

# Requirements
1. Python 3.7
2. Tensorflow 2.6
3. Tensorflow-addons

Additional requirements listed in requirements.yaml file.

## Installation

Recommended to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)

```
conda env create -f requirements.yml
conda activate tf-gpu
```

# Usage
## Data Preparation
(in progress)

## Training
(in progress)

## Perform detection

# How it works

This project has helped me understand the process behind object detectors which includes: data processing, model construction and output processing. Below I will explain the jist of these processes as I believe to understand something, you should be able to explain it. 

## Running the data preprocessing

...

## Data Augmentation

As a little bonus, I decided to implement adaptive data augmentation for training ...

## Model

Below displays the architecture of the model used ... (in progress)

## Outputs
